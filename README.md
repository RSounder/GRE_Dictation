# GRE_Dictation
Practice GRE vocab words with an e-buddy who helps you test and memorize high frequency words and meanings. All without spending a dime!
The words are accessed from the google sheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJ0x1d1AVdZNGuPRykUgs9QqUsSVeeEERjGFl6l7Xww/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Words4Py</a>

The words are derived from Gregmat's word list. Thanks to <a href= "https://www.gregmat.com/">Gregmat</a> (could'nt find his real name!)
